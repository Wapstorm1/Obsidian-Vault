An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is like a **messenger** that helps two systems (like apps, websites, or software) talk to each other.


**Simple Explanation**

• Imagine you’re at a restaurant:

• The **menu** is the API—it shows what you can order.

• You (the client) choose something from the menu.

• The **kitchen** (server) cooks the food you ordered.

• The waiter (API) brings your food back to you.

  

Similarly:

• Your app asks the API for data (like a list of products).

• The API gets the data from the server and gives it back to the app.
