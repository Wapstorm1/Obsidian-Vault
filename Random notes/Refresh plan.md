## **CORE OBJECTIVE (30 DAYS)**

  

Restore mental stability, stop dopamine sabotage, make yourself **placeable** for a QA role.

Not growth. Not mastery. Stability and clarity.

---

## **NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS**

- No learning tech skills
    
- No learning math
    
- No productivity systems
    
- No “preparing for the future”
    
- No mass job applications
    
- No porn
    

  

If these break, everything else degrades.

---

## **DAILY STRUCTURE**

  

### **1. Job Search (30–45 min total)**

- Max 1 application per day
    
- 3–5 applications per week
    
- One base CV
    
- Light tailoring only (10–15 min)
    
- Log and stop
    

  

No scrolling. No “maybe I’ll apply later”. End cleanly.

---

### **2. Work**

- Do the job.
    
- Do not emotionally invest.
    
- Do not try to grow there.
    
- It is income, not identity.
    

---

### **3. Physical Anchor (mandatory)**

- Gym + soccer stays
    
- Add walking or stretching on rest days
    

  

This is regulation, not fitness optimization.

---

### **4. Free Time (structured but simple)**

  

Use **Tier 1 and Tier 2 only**.

  

#### **Tier 1 — Stabilizers (default)**

- Walking without phone
    
- Stretching / mobility
    
- Cooking, cleaning, organizing
    
- Long showers
    
- Sitting outside doing nothing specific
    

  

#### **Tier 2 — Neutral pleasure (limited)**

- Reading non-technical books
    
- Movies or single episodes
    
- Light single-player gaming (finite sessions only)
    
- Writing thoughts without goals
    

  

No feeds. No tracking. No progress pressure.

---

## **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN (30 DAYS)**

- Tech learning (Java, automation, SQL, API)
    
- Math study (books, courses, structure)
    
- Career YouTube / productivity content
    
- New ambitious hobbies
    
- CV rewrites beyond light tailoring
    
- Comparing yourself to others
    
- Overthinking “what I should be doing”
    

  

These reactivate the failure loop.

---

## **PORN RULE (CRITICAL)**

  

Zero tolerance.

  

Not moral. Neurological.

  

If urge appears:

- Leave the room
    
- Walk
    
- Cold shower
    
- Physical movement
    

  

Porn destroys attention, memory, confidence, and job search outcomes. This is causality.

---

## **WEEKLY CHECKPOINT (once per week)**

  

Evaluate only:

- Did I respect time limits?
    
- Did I avoid forbidden activities?
    
- Did anxiety decrease slightly?
    

  

Do not evaluate progress, intelligence, or future.

---

## **WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE AT DAY 30**

- Lower baseline anxiety
    
- Fewer compulsive urges
    
- Ability to sit quietly without panic
    
- Clear QA identity
    
- Stable CV
    
- Some interview callbacks OR clear signal that CV positioning needs adjustment
    

  

That is enough.

---

## **WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DAY 30 (not now)**

  

Only after stability:

- Reintroduce learning slowly
    
- Narrow scope
    
- Tie learning to real work context
    

  

Until then, learning is poison.

---

## **FINAL RULE (DO NOT IGNORE)**

  

You are not fixing your life in 30 days.

You are **stopping the damage**.

  

Once damage stops, growth restarts automatically.

  

This phase feels passive.

It is the most strategic thing you can do right now.
