### **ðŸ§  Hereâ€™s What Else Happens in Test Closure:**

1. ðŸ“Š **Write a Test Summary Report**
    
    - What was tested, how much passed, how many bugs found, any risks that remain
        
    
2. ðŸ“¦ **Archive test artifacts**
    
    - Test cases, logs, screenshots, test data â€” keep them for audits or retesting
        
    
3. ðŸ‘¥ **Retrospective or review with the team**
    
    - What went well? What didnâ€™t? What can we improve?
        
    
4. âœ… **Make sure exit criteria were met**
    
    - Confirm: are we _done_, or is something incomplete?
