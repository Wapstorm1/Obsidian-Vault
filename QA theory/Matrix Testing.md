**Matrix Testing** is a **white-box or grey-box testing technique** that uses a **matrix structure** to validate the relationships between various elements of a system, such as inputs, conditions, and expected outputs. It is often used to ensure traceability and completeness in testing, focusing on verifying that each requirement is adequately tested.

**Key Features of Matrix Testing**

1. **Purpose**:
• To verify that all combinations of inputs, actions, and conditions are tested.
• Ensures traceability between requirements and test cases.

2. **Basis**:
• A matrix (tabular format) that maps inputs, actions, or requirements to test cases or outputs.

3. **Applicable Areas**:
• Complex systems with multiple inputs and conditions.
• Ensuring coverage of requirements in both manual and automated test planning.

**How to Perform Matrix Testing**

1. **Define Components**:
• Identify the elements to be tested (e.g., inputs, actions, conditions, outputs).

2. **Create the Matrix**:
• Build a table where rows represent one set of elements (e.g., inputs) and columns represent another (e.g., actions or expected outputs).

3. **Map Relationships**:
• Fill the matrix by mapping relationships (e.g., which input triggers which condition).

4. **Design Test Cases**:
• Use the completed matrix to create test cases ensuring all combinations are covered.

5. **Execute Tests**:
• Run the test cases and verify the system behavior against the matrix.
