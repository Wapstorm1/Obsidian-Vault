**Smoke Testing** is a quick check of critical functionalities after a new build to ensure the application is stable for further testing.

1. **Purpose**: Verify core features work (e.g., login, homepage load).
2. **Scope**: Shallow and broad, focusing on essential workflows.
3. **When**: After every build deployment.
4. **Performed By**: QA testers or developers.
5. **Outcome**: If critical features fail, the build is rejected.

**Example:**

For an e-commerce app:
• Homepage loads successfully.
• Login works with valid credentials.
• Add a product to the cart.

**Smoke vs. Sanity Testing:**

• **Smoke**: Broad, verifies stability of a build.

• **Sanity**: Focused, validates specific fixes or changes.
