• **Definition**: A hybrid of white-box and black-box testing, where the tester has partial knowledge of the internal workings of the application.

• **Performed By**: Testers with both technical and functional knowledge of the system.

• **Focus**:
• Combine internal logic testing with external behavior validation.
• Identify integration issues, security flaws, and design inconsistencies.

• **Common Techniques**:

• **Matrix Testing**:
• Ensures all requirements are linked to test cases and validated.

• **Regression Testing**:
• Tests internal functionality affected by recent changes.

• **Pattern-Based Testing**:
• Identifies issues based on patterns (e.g., known security flaws or common defects in similar systems).

• **Advantages**:
• Balanced approach with access to both internal and external perspectives.
• Detects issues overlooked in purely white-box or black-box testing.
• More effective for integration testing.

• **Disadvantages**:
• Requires both programming and domain knowledge.
• May not be suitable for extremely large or complex systems.
