**Definition of Done (DoD)** is a **clear checklist** of criteria that a task, user story, or feature must meet to be considered complete. It ensures consistency, quality, and alignment across the team.

**Key Aspects of Definition of Done**

1. **Purpose**:
• Ensures that all work is completed to an agreed standard before it’s considered done.
• Prevents unfinished or poor-quality work from moving to production.

2. **When to Use**:
• Applied at various levels: user stories, sprints, releases, or project deliverables.

3. **Common DoD Checklist**:
• Code is written and reviewed (peer-reviewed or approved via pull requests).
• Code is unit tested and passes automated tests.
• Functional and non-functional tests are complete.
• Documentation (if applicable) is updated (e.g., user guides, technical specs).
• Feature is deployed to a staging environment.
• Accepted by the product owner or stakeholders.

**Example of a Definition of Done**

• For a **user story**:
1. All acceptance criteria are met.
2. No critical or high-severity defects remain.
3. Code is merged to the main branch.
4. All automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) pass.
5. Documentation is updated.

• For a **release**:
1. All features in the release are validated.
2. Performance benchmarks are met.
3. Deployment to production is successful.
4. Stakeholders have signed off.
