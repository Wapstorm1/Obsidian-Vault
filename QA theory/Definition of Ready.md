**Definition of Ready (DoR)** is a **set of criteria** that a task or user story must meet before it is ready to be worked on. It ensures clarity and preparedness, reducing ambiguity during development.

**Key Aspects of Definition of Ready**

1. **Purpose**:
• Ensures that tasks or user stories are well-defined, achievable, and ready for implementation.
• Prevents delays caused by unclear or incomplete requirements.

2. **When to Use**:
• Applied during sprint planning, backlog grooming, or before development begins.

3. **Common DoR Checklist**:
• User story has a clear title and description.
• Acceptance criteria are defined.
• Dependencies are identified and resolved.
• Business value or priority is clear.
• The story is estimated (story points or time).
• The team understands the task (technical feasibility is reviewed).

**Example of a Definition of Ready**

• For a **user story**:
1. Description and acceptance criteria are complete and clear.
2. The story is small enough to be completed within one sprint.
3. No unresolved blockers or dependencies.
4. Stakeholders have reviewed and approved the story.

• For a **task**:
1. Pre-requisite work is complete.
2. Necessary assets (e.g., designs, API specs) are available.
3. Relevant team members are aligned.
