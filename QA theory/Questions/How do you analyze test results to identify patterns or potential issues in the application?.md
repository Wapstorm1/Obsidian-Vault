1. **Aggregate Test Results**:
• Collect results from automated and manual test runs.
• Include pass/fail statuses, execution times, and defect logs.

2. **Identify Failed Test Cases**:
• Focus on recurring failures to pinpoint problematic areas.
• Example: Login test failing consistently in specific browsers.

3. **Group Similar Defects**:
• Categorize defects by functionality, severity, or module.
• Example: Multiple UI-related issues in the payment module.

4. **Analyze Trends**:
• Look for patterns in test failures over time.
• Example: Increased failures after a specific feature update.

5. **Review Logs and Metrics**:
• Check application and test logs for clues (e.g., API response times, database errors).
• Use metrics like defect density to identify high-risk areas.

6. **Collaborate with the Team**:
• Discuss findings with developers and stakeholders to validate root causes.

7. **Prioritize Critical Issues**:
• Focus on high-severity defects or areas impacting core functionality.
