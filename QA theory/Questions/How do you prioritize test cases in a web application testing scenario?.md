When prioritizing test cases for a web application, the focus is on **risk, criticality, and impact**. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Focus on Critical Functionalities**:
• Test core features like login, payment, and navigation
• High impact on business and users.

2. **Test High-Risk Areas**:
• Prioritize modules with recent changes or complex integrations.
• Example: Third-party APIs.

3. **Consider User Impact**:
• Test frequently used features like forms, responsiveness, and navigation.
• Defects here lead to poor user experiences.

4. **Address Compliance and Security**:
• Test authentication, payment security, and data privacy.
• High impact on trust and legal compliance.

5. **Cover Regression and Impact Areas**:
• Focus on areas affected by updates to ensure no new bugs.
• Example: Changes in cart functionality should trigger checkout tests.

6. **Include Non-Functional Tests**:
• Prioritize performance, compatibility, and accessibility testing.
