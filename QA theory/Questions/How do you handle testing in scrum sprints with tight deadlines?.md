1. **Collaborate Early**:
• Join sprint planning to understand user stories and define acceptance criteria upfront.
• Break down stories into testable units.

2. **Prioritize Critical Tests**:
• Focus on high-risk and core functionalities first.
• Perform smoke and sanity tests to ensure basic stability.

3. **Leverage Automation**:
• Automate regression and repetitive tests to save time for exploratory and new feature testing.

4. **Test in Parallel**:
• Start testing as soon as development delivers increments, even partially.
• Use mock data or APIs if integrations aren’t ready.

5. **Communicate Regularly**:
• Provide quick feedback in daily stand-ups to resolve blockers and defects faster.

6. **Time-Box Testing**:
• Focus testing effort within the sprint, ensuring stories meet the **Definition of Done (DoD)** by the end.


**Example**:

For a login feature:
• Day 1-2: Smoke test basic login flow.
• Day 3-4: Test edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, session handling).
• Day 5: Validate across devices and browsers.
