In practice, ensuring **test coverage** is often a balance between **thoroughness** and **practicality**, as teams rarely have unlimited time or resources. Here’s how it’s typically done in real-world projects:


**1. Start with Requirements**

• **Practical Approach**:
• QA teams analyze requirements (BRDs, user stories, acceptance criteria) during sprint planning or refinement sessions.
• Create test scenarios for each requirement.
• Tools like JIRA are commonly used to link requirements to test cases.

• **Example**:
• If a requirement states, “Users must log in with valid credentials,” QA writes test cases for:
• Valid login.
• Invalid login.
• Edge cases (e.g., max-length username).


**2. Focus on Critical Areas First**

• **Practical Approach**:
• Identify the most critical workflows (e.g., payment processing, login) and prioritize their test coverage.
• Start testing core functionality before moving to edge cases or non-critical features.

• **Example**:
• An e-commerce app focuses first on:
• Search functionality.
• Add-to-cart and checkout processes.

**3. Reuse Existing Test Artifacts**

• **Practical Approach**:
• Use regression suites or reusable test cases for features that haven’t changed significantly.
• Modify only where new changes impact functionality.

• **Example**:
• For a minor update in the login screen, reuse existing test cases for login but add new ones for the updated areas.


**4. Collaborate with the Team**

• **Practical Approach**:
• Regular discussions with developers, product owners, and stakeholders to ensure no critical functionality is missed.
• Peer reviews of test scenarios and cases are common in Agile teams.

• **Example**:
• During sprint planning, the QA team asks:
• “Are there any hidden dependencies or complex workflows we should cover?”

**5. Exploratory Testing to Fill Gaps**

• **Practical Approach**:
• After planned test cases are executed, QA testers explore the system for untested workflows or edge cases.

• **Example**:
• While testing a search bar, a tester manually tries special characters or excessively long inputs.


**6. Validation with Traceability**

• **Practical Approach**:
• Ensure all user stories or requirements are mapped to at least one test case.
• Use an RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix) in tools like Excel, JIRA, or Zephyr.

• **Example**:
• A feature requiring “Password reset via email” is linked to test cases for:
• Email validation.
• Password reset link expiration.
