**What They’re Looking For:**

Your ability to apply different testing techniques, identify edge cases, and think critically about common functionalities.

**Key Test Areas:**

1. **Functional Testing**:
• Verify valid credentials allow successful login.
• Verify invalid credentials display appropriate error messages.
• Check behavior when required fields are left blank.
• Ensure case sensitivity where applicable (e.g., passwords are case-sensitive).

2. **Boundary Value Analysis**:
• Test minimum and maximum input lengths for username and password fields.
• Example: Test username with 1 character, 50 characters, and exceeding the limit.

3. **Security Testing**:
• Test against SQL injection or script injection in input fields.
• Check behavior after multiple failed login attempts (e.g., account lockout).
• Verify HTTPS is used for secure transmission of credentials.

4. **Usability Testing**:
• Validate error messages are user-friendly and clear.
• Ensure proper focus and navigation flow using keyboard (e.g., Tab key behavior).
• Verify “Remember Me” or “Forgot Password” functionalities, if available.

5. **Performance Testing**:
• Test login under high concurrent user load.
• Ensure response times are within acceptable limits.

6. **Cross-Browser/Device Testing**:
• Test login on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
  
**Sample Answer**:

“For a login page, I would start with functional tests to ensure correct behavior with valid and invalid credentials. Next, I’d focus on edge cases like empty inputs, maximum input lengths, and invalid formats. I would also perform security tests to check for vulnerabilities like SQL injection and verify that credentials are transmitted securely. Finally, I’d test usability, cross-browser compatibility, and performance under load.”
