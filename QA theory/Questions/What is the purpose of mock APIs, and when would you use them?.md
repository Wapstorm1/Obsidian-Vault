Mock APIs simulate the behavior of real APIs, allowing developers and testers to test and develop applications without relying on the actual API being available or functional.


**When to Use Mock APIs**

1. **API Development is Incomplete**:
• Use mock APIs to test front-end functionality when the backend isn’t ready.

2. **Faster Testing**:
• Mock APIs eliminate dependencies on slow or unstable APIs, speeding up testing.

3. **Simulate Different Scenarios**:
• Easily simulate responses for different status codes (e.g., 200, 404, 500) or edge cases.

4. **Isolated Testing**:
• Test specific modules independently without depending on real API availability.

5. **Cost Efficiency**:
• Avoid costs associated with hitting real APIs in environments like production or third-party services.

**Example Use Case:**

• While developing a shopping cart, the payment gateway API isn’t ready. Mock APIs simulate payment responses (success, failure, timeout), enabling the cart workflow to be tested.
