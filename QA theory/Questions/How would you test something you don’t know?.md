**What They’re Looking For:**

This question assesses your ability to handle unfamiliar systems or requirements. They want to see problem-solving skills, adaptability, and a structured approach.

**How to Respond:**

1. **Understand the Context**:
• Ask clarifying questions to gather information about the system or feature.
• Example: “Can you provide documentation, requirements, or a demo?”

2. **Explore and Research**:
• Interact with the system to understand its purpose, behavior, and flow.
• Research similar systems or features if possible.

3. **Collaborate**:
• Work with developers, product owners, or stakeholders to fill in knowledge gaps.

4. **Apply Generic Testing Techniques**:
• Use universal test strategies like exploratory testing, equivalence partitioning, and boundary value analysis.

5. **Document Your Findings**:
• Create notes or initial test cases as you learn more about the system.

**Sample Answer**:

“If I were testing something unfamiliar, I would first gather as much information as possible by reviewing documentation, asking stakeholders, or observing the application. Then, I would explore the system hands-on to understand its behavior. Using standard testing techniques, I’d develop a baseline set of test cases and iteratively refine them as I learn more.”
