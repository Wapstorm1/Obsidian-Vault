**Key Test Areas:**

1. **Functional Testing**:
• Search with exact matches and partial matches.
• Search with no results (e.g., inputting gibberish).

2. **Input Validation**:
• Test invalid characters, SQL injection, and excessively long inputs.

3. **Boundary Testing**:
• Test the minimum and maximum character limits for the search field.

4. **Usability Testing**:
• Validate auto-suggestions or typeahead functionality.
• Check if the search results are sorted correctly or highlighted.

5. **Performance Testing**:
• Test the response time of searches under varying loads.

6. **Cross-Device Testing**:
• Test the search functionality on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

**Sample Answer**:

“I would test search functionality by verifying results for exact, partial, and no matches. I’d also test input validation, including special characters and long strings. To ensure usability, I’d check auto-suggestions and result sorting. Finally, I’d perform performance and compatibility tests.”
