**Situation**:

During testing, I noticed that the “Forgot Password” feature only allowed email recovery, but the product owner expected both email and SMS options, which wasn’t specified clearly in the requirements.

**Action**:

1. Scheduled a quick meeting with the product owner and developers to clarify the requirement.
2. Highlighted the gap and confirmed that SMS recovery was also needed.
3. Updated the requirements and added test cases for both email and SMS recovery flows.
4. 
**Result**:

The feature was updated to include both recovery options without delaying the sprint timeline, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations.
