**Shift-Left Testing** is a practice of involving testing activities **earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC)**, typically during the requirements, design, or development phases. The goal is to detect and fix defects sooner, reducing cost and effort.


**Why is Shift-Left Testing Important?**

1. **Early Defect Detection**:
• Bugs found during requirements or design are cheaper and faster to fix compared to post-release.

2. **Improved Quality**:
• Testing early ensures better alignment with requirements and reduces rework.

3. **Faster Feedback**:
• Automated unit and integration tests in CI/CD pipelines provide immediate feedback to developers.

4. **Cost Efficiency**:
• Fixing defects later in development or after release is significantly more expensive.

5. **Collaborative Development**:
• Encourages QA, developers, and stakeholders to work together from the beginning.

**Example of Shift-Left Testing:**

• **Traditional Approach**: Testing starts after development is complete.

• **Shift-Left Approach**:

• Review requirements and create test cases during planning.

• Perform static code analysis and write unit tests during development.

• Continuously test in CI/CD pipelines.
