A **Test Plan** is a formal document that outlines the **testing scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and approach** for a project. It serves as a roadmap for the QA team to ensure all testing activities are well-organized and aligned with project goals.

1. **Introduction**:
• Brief overview of the project and its objectives.
• Example: “This test plan is for the login module of an e-commerce application.”

2. **Scope**:
• Defines what will be tested and what is out of scope.

• Example:
• In-Scope: Login functionality, password recovery.
• Out-of-Scope: Admin dashboard.

3. **Test Objectives**:
• The goals of the testing effort.

• Example:
• Verify login functionality with valid and invalid credentials.
• Ensure password recovery emails are sent correctly.

4. **Test Approach**:
• The strategy for testing.

• Example:
• Use manual testing for exploratory and functional tests.
• Use automation for regression tests.

5. **Test Deliverables**:
• List of documents or artifacts to be delivered.

• Example:
• Test cases, test reports, defect logs.

6. **Entry and Exit Criteria**:
• **Entry Criteria**: Conditions to start testing.

• Example: “Build is deployed to the QA environment.”
• **Exit Criteria**: Conditions to end testing.

• Example: “All critical and high-priority defects are resolved.”

7. **Schedule**:
• Timeline for testing activities.

• Example: “Functional testing from Jan 15 to Jan 25.”

8. **Resources**:
• Team members, tools, and environments needed.

• Example:
• Team: 2 QA testers, 1 test lead.
• Tools: Selenium, JIRA.

9. **Risks and Mitigation**:
• Potential challenges and their solutions.

• Example:
• Risk: “Delays in environment setup.”
• Mitigation: “Use a staging environment temporarily.”
