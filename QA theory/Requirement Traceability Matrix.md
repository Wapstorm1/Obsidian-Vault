A **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)** is a document that maps **requirements** to their associated **test cases**. It ensures that all requirements are tested and helps track the progress and coverage of testing activities.

1. **Purpose**:
• Ensure every requirement is covered by at least one test case.
• Identify untested or missing requirements.

2. **Types of RTM**:
• **Forward Traceability**: Links requirements to test cases.
• **Backward Traceability**: Ensures test cases map back to requirements.
• **Bidirectional Traceability**: Combines forward and backward traceability.

3. **When to Use**:
• During test planning and execution to validate coverage.
• For audits or compliance purposes.

**How to Create an RTM**

1. **List Requirements**:
• Extract requirements from documentation or user stories.

2. **Map Test Cases**:
• Link each requirement to one or more test cases.

3. **Track Test Status**:
• Update the RTM with test execution results (e.g., Pass, Fail, Not Executed).

4. **Review Regularly**:
• Ensure all new requirements are added to the RTM.
