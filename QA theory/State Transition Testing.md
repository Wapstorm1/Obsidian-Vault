**State Transition Testing** is a **black-box testing technique** used to validate that a system transitions correctly from one state to another based on specific inputs or events. It is particularly useful for systems where various inputs cause the application to change states.

**Key Features of State Transition Testing**

1. **Purpose**:
• Test how the application behaves when transitioning between states.
• Ensure all possible transitions and actions are covered.

2. **Basis**:
• Uses a **State Transition Diagram** or **State Table** to model system states and transitions.

3. **Applicable Areas**:
• Systems with workflows or finite states, such as:
• Login/logout systems.
• ATM transactions.
• E-commerce order processing.
• Elevator controls.

**How to Perform State Transition Testing**

1. **Identify States**:
• List all possible states of the system.

2. **Define Events and Transitions**:
• Determine what events cause state changes and define transitions between states.

3. **Create a State Diagram or Table**:
• Visualize the states, inputs, and transitions in a diagram or tabular form.

4. **Design Test Cases**:
• Write test cases for valid transitions, invalid transitions, and edge cases.

5. **Execute and Verify**:
• Test the system to ensure correct behavior for all defined transitions.
