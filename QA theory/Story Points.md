**Story Points** are a unit of measurement used in **Agile project management** to estimate the effort required to complete a user story. They represent a combination of complexity, risk, and effort, rather than time, and help teams prioritize and plan their work more effectively.

**Key Features of Story Points**

1. **Purpose**:
• Provide a consistent way to estimate work across a team.
• Encourage relative sizing of tasks instead of focusing on exact time estimates.

2. **Characteristics**:
• Not directly tied to hours or days.
• Assigned based on the relative effort compared to other user stories.

3. **Used In**:
• Sprint planning to estimate the velocity and capacity of the team.
• Prioritizing backlog items.


**How to Set Story Points**

1. **Relative Estimation**:
• Compare stories to each other rather than estimating them in isolation.
• Example: If “Task A” feels twice as complex as “Task B,” assign it twice the story points.

2. **Use a Consistent Scale**:
• Common scales include:
• **Fibonacci Sequence**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc. (avoids over-precision).
• **T-shirt Sizes**: XS, S, M, L, XL (converted into numbers later).
• Custom Scales: Any predefined range like 1–10.
• Fibonacci is popular because the gap between numbers encourages more meaningful discussions.

3. **Collaborative Estimation**:
• Use team-wide discussions to agree on story points, often with techniques like **Planning Poker**.

4. **Establish Baselines**:
• Identify a reference story (e.g., “Story X = 3 points”) that everyone agrees on.
• Use it to benchmark other stories.

5. **Break Down Large Stories**:
• If a story feels too large or unclear, split it into smaller stories or tasks.
• Example: A 21-point story might be broken into two 8-point stories and one 5-point story.


**Steps for Assigning Story Points**

1. **Review the User Story**:
• Understand the requirements, scope, and potential challenges.

2. **Discuss with the Team**:
• Consider all aspects: development, testing, integration, etc.

3. **Estimate Using Planning Poker**:
• Each team member privately selects a number representing their estimate.
• Reveal numbers simultaneously, then discuss discrepancies.
• Repeat until consensus is reached.

4. **Assign Points**:
• Once the team agrees, assign the story points to the user story.
