• **Definition**: Testing the application’s functionality without any knowledge of the internal implementation or code. Focuses on inputs and expected outputs.

• **Performed By**: Testers, end-users, or QA professionals.

• **Focus**:
• Functional requirements.
• User interface and behavior.

• **Common Techniques**:
• **Equivalence Partitioning**:
• Divides input data into equivalent partitions to reduce test cases.

• **Boundary Value Analysis**:
• Tests edge cases at the boundaries of input ranges.

• **Decision Table Testing**:
• Examines combinations of inputs and outputs using decision tables.

• **State Transition Testing**:
• Validates system behavior based on state changes.

• **Exploratory Testing**:
• Ad-hoc testing to uncover unexpected issues.

• **Advantages**:
• No programming knowledge required.
• Focuses on user expectations and experience.
• Useful for large-scale systems with many end-users.

• **Disadvantages**:
• Limited insight into internal issues or code-related defects.
• Ineffective at identifying performance or security issues.
