A **Test Strategy** is a high-level document that outlines the **approach and methodology** for testing a software project. It is typically part of the **Test Plan** but focuses on the **“how”** of testing rather than specific details like schedules or resources.

1. **Testing Objectives**:
• The goals of the testing process.
• Example: “Ensure the web application meets functional and performance requirements before release.”

2. **Scope of Testing**:
• Define what is in scope and out of scope.
• Example:

• **In-Scope**: Login functionality, cart operations, payment processing.

• **Out-of-Scope**: Third-party integrations for this release.

3. **Testing Approach**:
• Outline how testing will be conducted.
• Example:

• **Manual Testing**: For exploratory and usability testing.

• **Automation Testing**: For regression and performance testing.

4. **Test Levels**:
• Specify the levels of testing involved.
• Example:

• Unit Testing: By developers.
• Integration Testing: For module interactions.
• System Testing: Full end-to-end testing.
• User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Stakeholder validation.

5. **Test Types**:
• List the types of tests to be performed.
• Example:

• Functional Testing
• Non-Functional Testing (Performance, Security)
• Regression Testing
• Exploratory Testing

6. **Test Tools**:
• Specify tools to be used.
• Example:

• **Automation**: Selenium, TestNG.
• **Bug Tracking**: JIRA.
• **Performance**: JMeter.

7. **Environment Requirements**:
• Define the test environments needed.
• Example: “QA environment with database backup and mock APIs for external systems.”

8. **Risk Management**:

• Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.
• Example:

• **Risk**: Delayed environment setup.
• **Mitigation**: Use a staging environment temporarily.

9. **Test Deliverables**:
• List what documents/artifacts will be produced.
• Example:

• Test cases, test reports, defect logs.

10. **Exit Criteria**:
• Define when testing can be considered complete.
• Example: “All high-severity defects are resolved, and 95% of test cases pass.”
