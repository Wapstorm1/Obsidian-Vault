Equivalence Partitioning is a **black-box testing technique** that divides input data into partitions (or classes) to reduce the number of test cases while maintaining effective coverage. The idea is that all inputs in a particular partition should be treated **equivalently** by the system and produce similar behavior.

**How to Perform Equivalence Partitioning?**

1. **Identify Inputs**:
• Determine the input domain of the application (e.g., valid/invalid values, ranges).

2. **Define Equivalence Classes**:
• Partition inputs into groups where all members are expected to behave the same.

3. **Select Test Cases**:
• Pick one representative value from each partition for testing.

4. **Execute and Verify**:
• Test the application with the chosen values and verify the output.

**Example of Equivalence Partitioning**

**Scenario**: Testing a field that accepts age inputs (valid range: 18 to 60).

1. **Input Partitioning**:
• **Valid Class**: 18 to 60.
• **Invalid Classes**:
• Below valid range: <18.
• Above valid range: >60.
• Non-numeric: Text, Special Characters.

2. **Representative Test Cases**:
• Valid: 25 (from the valid range 18-60).
• Invalid:
• 10 (from the <18 class).
• 65 (from the >60 class).
• "abc" (from the non-numeric class).

**When to Use Equivalence Partitioning?**

1. Input fields with specified ranges, formats, or discrete categories.
2. Scenarios where testing every possible input is impractical (e.g., large input ranges).
3. Use in combination with **Boundary Value Analysis** for more robust testing.
