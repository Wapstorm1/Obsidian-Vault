**Sanity Testing** is a focused test to verify that **specific changes or bug fixes** in a build work as expected and have not impacted related functionalities.

**Key Points:**

1. **Purpose**: Validate specific fixes or new features.
2. **Scope**: Narrow and targeted at the affected areas.
3. **When**: After receiving a build with minor changes or bug fixes.
4. **Performed By**: QA testers.
5. **Outcome**: Confirms the build is ready for more detailed testing.

**Example:**

For a bug fix in an e-commerce app:
• Verify the “Add to Cart” button now works.
• Ensure cart updates correctly after adding an item.


> [!NOTE] Quick explanation
> So we do Sanity testing when there was some fix deployed and we quickly check it. Without going deep.
