• **Definition**: Testing the internal logic, structure, and code of the application. It’s also known as **clear-box testing** or **glass-box testing**.

• **Performed By**: Developers or testers with programming knowledge.

• **Focus**:
• Code structure.
• Internal paths and flow.
• Specific algorithms.

• **Common Techniques**:
• **Code Coverage Testing**:
• Verifies how much of the code is executed.
• Types: Statement coverage, branch coverage, condition coverage, etc.

• **Path Testing**:
• Tests all possible execution paths in the application.

• **Unit Testing**:
• Focuses on testing individual components of the code.

• **Loop Testing**:
• Examines loops in the code (e.g., single, nested, or conditional loops).

• **Advantages**:
• Identifies security vulnerabilities, inefficient code, and logical errors.
• High level of detail since it examines the code directly.

• **Disadvantages**:
• Requires deep knowledge of programming.
• Time-consuming and not practical for large-scale systems.
