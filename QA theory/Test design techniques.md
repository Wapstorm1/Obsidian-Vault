**[[Equivalence Partitioning]]**:
• Divide input data into partitions and test one value from each.

**[[Boundary Value Analysis]]**:
• Focus on edge cases at boundaries.

 **[[Decision Table Testing]]**:
• Test combinations of inputs using a decision table.

 **[[Exploratory Testing]]**:
• Test without predefined test cases; focus on finding hidden issues.

**[[Error Guessing]]**:
• Use intuition and experience to identify common defects.

**[[State Transition Testing]]**:
• Examines behavior when transitioning from one state to another based on events or conditions.

**[[Use Case Testing]]**:
• Validates end-to-end user scenarios derived from use cases.

**[[Pairwise Testing]]**:
• Reduces test combinations by focusing on pairs of input parameters to maximize coverage.

**Ad-Hoc Testing**:
• In general this is kinda doing random action to find unusual errors or behaviours. 

**[[Matrix Testing]]**:
• Maps requirements or features to test cases to ensure full coverage.

**[[Database Testing]]**:
• Verifies database integrity, schema, triggers, and stored procedures.
