**Exit Criteria** are conditions that must be met for a testing phase or project to be considered complete. These criteria ensure that the testing process achieves its objectives before transitioning to the next phase.

**Key Aspects of Exit Criteria**

1. **Purpose**:
• Defines the minimum success standards for concluding a testing phase.
• Prevents premature release or transition of a product with unresolved issues.

2. **When to Use**:
• At the end of a testing phase (e.g., unit testing, system testing, UAT).
• Before release or delivery.

3. **Common Exit Criteria**:
• All planned test cases are executed.
• Defect density is within acceptable limits.
• All critical and high-priority defects are resolved.
• Regression tests are complete and pass.
• Test coverage meets or exceeds the agreed threshold (e.g., 90%).
• Performance benchmarks are met.

**Example of Exit Criteria**

• For **System Testing**:
1. All functional test cases pass.
2. No critical or high-severity defects remain.
3. Regression suite passes with 100% success.
4. Performance metrics (e.g., response time, scalability) are validated.

• For **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
1. All UAT test cases are executed.
2. Stakeholders sign off on UAT results.
3. Business workflows are validated.
