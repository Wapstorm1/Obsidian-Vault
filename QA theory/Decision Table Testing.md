**Key Features of Decision Table Testing**

1. **Purpose**:
• To model complex decision-making scenarios systematically.
• Helps in identifying missing or incorrect logic in the software.

2. **Basis**:
• Represents conditions (inputs) and actions (outputs) in a tabular format.
• Each combination of conditions corresponds to a unique test case.

3. **Applicable Areas**:
• Business rules validation.
• Applications with multiple conditions and dependencies.
• Workflow-driven systems like loan approval, insurance processing, or e-commerce.

**Structure of a Decision Table**

A decision table typically includes:
1. **Conditions** (Input Factors): Possible inputs or states that influence the behavior.
2. **Actions** (Output Factors): Possible outcomes based on the conditions.
3. **Rules**: Unique combinations of conditions and their corresponding actions.

**Steps to Create a Decision Table**

1. **Identify Conditions**:
• List all input conditions or decision points.

2. **Determine Actions**:
• Define all possible outcomes based on the inputs.

3. **Construct the Table**:
• Create a table with conditions as rows and unique combinations of inputs as columns.
• Map each combination of inputs to the corresponding action.

4. **Define Test Cases**:
• Each column (rule) in the table becomes a unique test case.
