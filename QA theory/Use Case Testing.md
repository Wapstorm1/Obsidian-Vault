**Use Case Testing** is a **black-box testing technique** that validates the functionality of a system by testing the scenarios (use cases) based on how end-users interact with it. This technique focuses on ensuring that the application behaves as expected when performing specific user tasks.


**Components of a Use Case**
1. **Actors**:
• External entities interacting with the system (e.g., users, other systems).

2. **Preconditions**:
• Conditions that must be true before the use case begins.

3. **Main Flow**:
• The primary, expected path through the system.

4. **Alternate Flows**:
• Possible deviations or exceptions from the main flow.

5. **Postconditions**:
• Conditions that must be true after the use case completes.


**Steps to Perform Use Case Testing**
1. **Identify Use Cases**:
• Review business requirements or use case documents to identify key user scenarios.

2. **Understand Workflows**:
• Break down the use cases into individual steps, including inputs and expected outputs.

3. **Design Test Cases**:
• Write test cases based on the main flow and alternate flows of the use cases.

4. **Execute and Verify**:
• Perform the test cases and validate the outputs against the expected outcomes.

5. **Document Results**:
• Record whether the test passed or failed and any issues encountered.
