**Key Test Areas:**

1. **Functional Testing**:
• Validate payment with valid and invalid card details.
• Verify error messages for expired, stolen, or blocked cards.

2. **Boundary Testing**:
• Test edge cases for CVV, card numbers, and expiration dates.

3. **Security Testing**:
• Ensure encryption of payment details.
• Test for vulnerabilities like man-in-the-middle attacks.

4. **Integration Testing**:
• Verify payment gateway integration with the backend system.
• Check notifications or emails triggered after payment.

5. **Performance Testing**:
• Test the payment process under heavy load.

**Sample Answer**:

“I would focus on testing valid and invalid payment scenarios, security (e.g., encrypted transmission of data), and usability (e.g., clear error messages). Additionally, I’d perform integration tests to ensure backend processing works and validate performance under heavy loads.”
