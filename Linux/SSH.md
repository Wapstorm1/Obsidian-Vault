Secure Shell.
> is a protocol that allows you to **securely connect to a remote machine** (like a server) from your local computer — using the command line.

### **As a QA, You Might Use SSH To:**

- Connect to a **staging environment on EC2**
- Check logs for failed tests
- Manually test the app or APIs directly on the server

**Example**: remember how had a Fedora on you main mac and connected to it using second mac. In the result you could use a Fedora OS on another mac using a terminal commands.
