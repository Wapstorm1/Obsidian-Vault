  In Global Payments you had access to the Jenkins jobs where you needed to trigger the build deployemnt of a mobile app. 
  
- Focused manual testing on high-risk areas such as wallet integrations, staking logic, and transaction consistency.

-  Identified critical calculation and reconciliation issues prior to release, preventing user-impacting defects?
