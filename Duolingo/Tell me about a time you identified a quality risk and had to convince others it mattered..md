Back in 8allocate I was testing a DeFi crypto currency web platform. 
For test and dev stages in testing purposes we were using small amount of crypto because it was easy and quicker to withdraw back and it was cheaper. After some time when we polished main functionality and design, stakeholders wanted to have a beta test with beta testers (users). I immediatly raised a question that it is not safe to make a beta test with real user when we only tested it with small amount. The developers and PO said it should be fine + we do not have extra resoursec for that. Next thing I did collected all my test resources to have one big amount to test the core feature. After the deposit the amount went into void, just one test proved immediatelly that it is not ready for a beta test. I created a bug report, assigned the dev who is responsible for the core features, informed team. After that we postponed the beta test,  fixed the issue and improved the backend logic, I retested the fix, added test to the regression and I got extra resource for doing tests with real users amount.
