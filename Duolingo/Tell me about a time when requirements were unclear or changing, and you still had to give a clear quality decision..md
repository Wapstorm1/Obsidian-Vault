At Stryber, requirements were often incomplete and changed during development because we were building MVPs. In those situations, I still had to give a clear quality decision before release.

What I did was base my decision on whether the product fulfilled its core user purpose. I focused testing on the main user flow, happy paths, and critical edge cases, and used exploratory testing to identify obvious blockers or data issues.

I consciously accepted known minor UI issues and incomplete secondary features, because fixing them would not change whether the product could be used as intended. When I gave a QA sign-off, I clearly communicated what was covered, what was not, and what risks remained, so the release decision was made consciously, not blindly.

That allowed us to ship functional MVPs despite changing requirements, without releasing products that failed their core purpose.
