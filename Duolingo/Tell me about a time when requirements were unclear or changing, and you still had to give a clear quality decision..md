At Stryber we were building MVP products with tight deadlines and frequently unclear requirements. I still had to provide QA sign-off before release.


First, I gathered all available information — user stories, documentation, and direct discussions with PMs, developers, and stakeholders. Then I identified the core purpose of the product and the main user flow that defined whether the product actually worked.

Based on that, I prioritized testing of core functionality, happy paths, data correctness, and critical edge cases. I consciously deprioritized minor UI issues or secondary features when they did not impact the main goal.

I tested builds incrementally, gave fast feedback to developers, and relied heavily on exploratory testing to uncover unpredictable behavior.

Before release, I ran regression on core areas, verified fixes, and provided a transparent QA report outlining what was tested, what was not, and what risks remained. This allowed us to ship functional MVPs despite unclear requirements.
