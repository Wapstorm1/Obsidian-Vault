I usually own testing of a new feature from the moment it's scoped to the release.S tart from understanding the main idea/purpose of the feature. After that i clarify acceptance criterias and some question with PM and devs.

For example in Stryber when I was working with MVPs mobile features with incomplete requirements, I firstly identified the core functionality. Based on that I decided what needed deep testing - happy paths, critical edge cases. data - and kept light coverage for secondary features. 



I start by understanding the user goal and clarifying acceptance criteria with the PM and developers. For example in Stryber when I was working with MVPs mobile features with incomplete requirements, then I identify the main risks, scope deep testing around core flows and edge cases, and keep lighter coverage for secondary behavior. I test incrementally during development, give fast feedback, and before release I run focused regression and provide a clear quality status with remaining risks for a go/no-go decision.
