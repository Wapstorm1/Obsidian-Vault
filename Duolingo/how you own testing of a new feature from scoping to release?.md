I usually own testing of a new feature from the moment it's scoped to the release.S tart from understanding the main idea/purpose of the feature. After that i clarify acceptance criterias and some question with PM and devs.

For example in Stryber when I was working with MVPs mobile features with incomplete requirements, I firstly identified the core functionality. Based on that I decided what needed deep testing - happy paths, critical edge cases. data - and kept light coverage for secondary features.
