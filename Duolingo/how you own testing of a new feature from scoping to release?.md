I own testing of a feature from scoping to release by first clarifying acceptance criteria and open questions with PM and developers. Then I identify the main purpose of the feature and the critical user flows. Based on that, I define key risk areas and decide where deep coverage is required versus lighter validation.

  

I test incrementally as builds become available, giving fast feedback to developers. I use exploratory testing to uncover edge cases and unpredictable behavior beyond predefined scenarios.

  

Before release, I run focused regression on related core flows, verify fixes, and provide a transparent QA report outlining what was tested, what was not, and any remaining risks so the release decision is conscious and informed.

1. Scoping - understand main idea of the feature + Acceptance criterias
2. Coverage planning - Identify core functionality and decide what to test and how deep
3. Execution - test builds as they develop (incrementally) and give feedback.
4. Release decision - regression, fixes, qa approval
