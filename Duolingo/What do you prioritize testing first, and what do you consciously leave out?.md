 When time is limited, I prioritize flows that, if broken, cause irreversible user harm. For example: onboarding, primary task completion, and progress persistence.

 I consciously skip cosmetic UI issues, secondary settings, and non-blocking edge personalization paths, because those don’t prevent the user from achieving the main goal.

At Stryber, as a solo QA on multiple MVPs, I focused on happy paths and critical edge cases of the main user flow and accepted known visual and minor UX issues. That allowed us to ship functional products that met the customer’s core expectations despite incomplete requirements and frequent design changes.
