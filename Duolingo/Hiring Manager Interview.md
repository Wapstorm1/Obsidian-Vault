- How you define risk
- When you would allow known bugs
- What makes a release a “no-go”
- How you separate user risk vs business risk
- Tell me about a mistake you made in QA.
- What kind of tester are you not?

- What do you struggle with as a QA?
  I feel most challenged when dealing with complex features that involve multiple systems or hidden dependencies. In those situations, I’ve learned that the key is asking more clarifying questions early and mapping out risks before jumping into testing. It’s an area where I’m actively improving — becoming more structured and confident in handling complexity.
-  How do you decide whether a bug is frontend or backend?
  I reproduce the issue, check the API response, and compare it with what the UI shows. If the backend response is correct but the UI is wrong, it’s frontend. If the response itself is wrong, it’s backend.
