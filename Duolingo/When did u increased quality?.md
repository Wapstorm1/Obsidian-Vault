==Tell me about a release where **you personally increased quality**, not just executed testing.==

==What problem existed before your involvement, what changed because of you, and how did you know quality improved?==


In global payments I was working with mobile devices. The testing on real devices always were a high priority I sued emulators ocasionally. After some time they implemented updated UI. And I noticed that on tablets some sreens were not fully displayed especially on small ones. The rotation could help but not very much, there was a problem with adaptive design. And than i wondered what would it look kile on fold phones which became a common things nowdays. I borrowed a foldable phone from my friend and sicovered that a lot of UI buttons were not displayed or had incorrect form and so on. So I insisted to add check on foldable devices as well. The result of this were that I got mine own for testing and company also implemented browserstack for such kind of things.
