1. **Risk-based** – Focus on areas with the highest business or technical risk. Consider:
    
    - Probability of failure
        
    - Impact if failure occurs
        
    - Complexity of the functionality
        
        Formula: Risk = Probability × Impact.
        
    
2. **Requirement-based** – Test most critical requirements first:
    
    - Regulatory or compliance-related
        
    - Core business workflows
        
    - Requirements with no fallback
        
    
3. **Usage frequency** – Prioritize the functions used most by users or that generate most revenue.
