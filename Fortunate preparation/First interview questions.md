* **Can you describe your approach when testing a new feature from scratch?**

Tell me how you usually get started, what steps you follow, how you work with others during the process, and how you ensure nothing slips through.

> First, I start by gathering all available information — like requirement documents, BRDs, or user stories. If documentation is missing or unclear, I reach out directly to the product owner, PM, or developer to clarify the feature. That initial understanding is key.
> Once I have a clear picture, I move to test design — choosing the best approach based on the feature type. That includes thinking through edge cases, negative paths, and user behavior. Then I create and execute the test cases, document the results, and raise any bugs in our tracking tool.
> If the feature is stable, I mark it for closure. If not, I collaborate with the developer to retest once fixes are made. I also make sure to update documentation and track any regression risks.


* **How do you approach exploratory testing?**
When do you use it, what’s your mindset during it, and how do you ensure it brings value to the team?

> I usually do exploratory testing after I’ve covered the main test cases — especially to uncover edge cases or behavior that might not be obvious. It’s really effective at catching issues that aren’t well defined or documented.
> I also rely on it when I’m joining a new team or testing a feature with no clear requirements. I treat it as both testing and learning — I interact with the product as a user would, push boundaries, and take notes on anything that feels off.
> To keep it useful for the team, I document what I find — even if there are no bugs — so we can track coverage or update future test cases.


> I haven’t been deeply involved in API automation yet, but I’ve explored how it works — including Postman’s test scripting and automation via CLI or Jenkins pipelines. So while I wouldn’t claim deep hands-on experience, I’m confident I could jump into it quickly if needed.”



> I believe strong collaboration starts with knowing your team — who’s responsible for what, and building good communication from day one.
> I stay closely connected to the developers whose features I’m testing — it helps me understand the technical side better, and they also know what I’m testing and when. I also make sure to talk with designers to clarify the user flow, especially for new features.
> During sprint planning, grooming, and retros, I try to actively participate — ask questions, raise risks early, and make sure we’re all aligned on the scope and quality expectations.
> Overall, I aim to be a collaborative, approachable teammate who can bridge gaps between QA, devs, and product.


> When I approach mobile testing, I start by clarifying the supported platforms and devices — including OS versions. I usually check with the PM or PO to understand the target user base and agree on device coverage based on that.
> Then I test using a mix of real devices and emulators — like Android Studio or Xcode. In some cases, we’ve also used BrowserStack or similar tools to cover more combinations.
> While a lot of the core testing is similar to web — like functionality and UX — mobile adds unique layers. I always check things like gesture behavior, screen responsiveness, push notifications, network conditions, and how the app handles OS-level interruptions like calls or backgrounding.


* How do you test how an app behaves across different app lifecycle [[states]]?

> I wouldn’t say I’m an expert in lifecycle testing, but I do apply it practically in projects when it makes sense. My usual approach is manual — I simulate common states like backgrounding the app, switching between apps, locking the screen, force quitting and reopening, and checking how the app resumes or reloads.
> I also pay attention to data persistence, session state, and whether the app behaves consistently after those actions. Of course, the depth of this testing depends on the release phase and how critical the feature is — but I try to cover at least the most user-facing lifecycle behaviors.




> [!NOTE] Imortant
>  Sure! I’ve been working as a Software QA Engineer for about four years, mostly focused on web and mobile applications. I’ve worked in different companies — from startups to mid-sized teams — where I was often the only QA or the first QA, which gave me a lot of ownership.
> 
> My main focus is on manual testing — functional, regression, exploratory — and I also work with APIs, databases, and mobile platforms. I’ve used tools like Postman, BrowserStack, SQL, Jira, and emulators like Android Studio and Xcode. I try to keep the user in mind that helps me to make sure taht we build right product.

> What I like is being involved in the full cycle — from talking with PMs and developers to designing tests and making sure the final product feels solid and user-friendly.
